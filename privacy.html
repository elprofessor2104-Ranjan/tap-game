  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: <strong>November 30, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>EL Rewards respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. This policy applies to information collected when you access our site or use our service.</p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Point/tap counts are stored locally in your browser using <code>localStorage</code>. We do this so counts persist across refreshes on the same device.</li>
    <li><strong>UPI ID:</strong> If you submit a redemption request, the UPI ID you provide is used only to process that redemption. We do not publish or sell UPI IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> We may collect aggregated, non-identifying metrics for improving the app (e.g., number of active users, crashes). This data is anonymized.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cookies and ads</h2>
  <p>We may use cookies and third-party services (such as Google AdSense and analytics) to display ads, measure traffic, and improve the user experience. These third parties may collect information about your visits and use cookies. Please visit the third party’s privacy pages (for example Google) to learn about their data practices.</p>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display and persist point balances on your device.</li>
    <li>To process redemption requests and coordinate payouts via UPI.</li>
    <li>To analyze and improve the service (aggregated analytics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited information with payment processors or partners strictly to fulfill a redemption request. In cases required by law, we may disclose information to comply with legal processes.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear local storage or browser data to remove locally stored point counts.</li>
    <li>If you want to request deletion of any data we hold, contact us at <a href="mailto:elprofessor2104@gmail.com">elprofessor2104@gmail.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect your data. However, no internet transmission is fully secure — take care when sharing sensitive information.</p>
