    <h1>About EL Rewards</h1>

    <p><strong>EL Rewards</strong> is a simple and transparent platform that lets users earn small rewards by performing lightweight, entry-level tasks using their device. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use experience so anyone — students, homemakers, or working professionals — can earn modest supplementary income in their free time.</p>

    <h2>What we offer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy activities like tapping, short tasks, and passive engagement that earn points.</li>
      <li>A clear conversion rate and redemption policy so users know how points convert to money.</li>
      <li>Local storage of point counts on the user's device — we do not require sign-in to accrue points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Conversion rates, minimum thresholds, and payout rules are clearly stated.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We only store the minimum data required to operate the app; details are in our Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> We aim to provide a reliable reward experience and prevent abuse of the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to get started</h2>
    <p>Open the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page, tap the circular “Tap Here” button to collect points, and watch your balance increase. When you reach the minimum threshold, you may request a redemption via UPI (details in Terms &amp; Conditions).</p>
